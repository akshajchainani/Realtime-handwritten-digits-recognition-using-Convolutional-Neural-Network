## Introduction

Handwritten digits recognition is a fundamental problem in the field of machine learning and computer vision. This project demonstrates the use of a CNN to recognize handwritten digits in real-time. The user interface provides a canvas where users can draw digits, and the model predicts the digit based on the drawing.

## Folder Structure

- `deep_learning`: Contains Jupyter notebooks for implementing the Convolutional Neural Network, data preprocessing, and model evaluation.
  - `digit_deep_learning.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook containing code and explanations for building, training, and evaluating the CNN model for handwritten digit recognition.
- `model`: This folder contains the pre-trained CNN model in TensorFlow.js format, including the `model.json` architecture file and two binary weight files.
- `server`: Includes the code for the server that handles real-time digit recognition requests.
  - `index.html`: An HTML file that provides a basic interface for drawing digits and getting real-time predictions.
  - `mnist_server.py`: A Python script that sets up a simple server to serve the HTML interface and handle digit recognition requests.
- `training`: Contains scripts and notebooks for training the CNN model on the MNIST dataset.
- `tfjs.html`: A simple HTML file that loads the pre-trained model using TensorFlow.js and provides the user interface for drawing and digit recognition.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Follow the instructions in the [Training](#training) section to train the CNN model or use the provided pre-trained model weights.

## Usage

1. Run the server by navigating to the `server` directory and executing `python mnist_server.py`.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
3. Use the canvas on the web page to draw a handwritten digit.
4. The server will communicate with the CNN model to predict the drawn digit and display it on the UI.

## Model

The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture used for this project is designed to effectively recognize handwritten digits. The pre-trained model, available in the `model` folder, consists of the `model.json` architecture file and two binary weight files.

## Training

The `training` folder contains scripts and notebooks to train the CNN model on the MNIST dataset. You can follow the provided instructions in the `digit_deep_learning.ipynb` notebook to train the model from scratch or adapt the training process to your own dataset.
